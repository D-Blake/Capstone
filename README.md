# Node Review - In Progress
 
A review project in which a desktop application and website were created to use data from the Firebase database. The desktop app was created using C# WPF and the website was created using ASP.NET MVC. The purpose is to provide places where someone can go to create and read reviews/ratings for media of multiple different types as well as being practice of known concepts/tools and learning of new concepts/tools. 

Majority of the code was completed within ~8 weeks (All commits within 2019)
Marked as 'In Progress' on due to wanting to fully flesh out this project and see what all I can do with it.
